### Customizing Head

You can customize the head section by modifying `_includes/custom-head.html`.

In principle, you can add anything here, such as a website icon. You just need to write the data into it.

You can use [Favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) to generate website icons.

### Creating Themes

If you want to make your own color schemes, modify the CSS variables in the `_sass/_variables.scss` stylesheet with a scoped data attribute or class name.

For example, below we've created the beginnings of a blue theme:

```scss
// Example blue theme
[data-theme="blue"] {
  --body-bg: var(--blue);
  --body-color: #fff;
}
```

Then, apply the theme by adding `data-theme="blue"` to the `<html>` element.

### Home page background

This file `_data/images.yml` contains the background of the homepage of the website.

You need to fill in these files according to the full path. If the bandwidth service you use is not enough to support high-resolution images or considering that the user's hardware configuration is often not satisfactory, I recommend you use 1080p resolution.

``` yml
  - /images/home/1080/
```

### Customizing Navigation

The file `_data/navigation.yml` to configure links to some pages. For example,

```yml
- title: About
  url: /about/
- title: Post
  url: /post/
- title: Tools
  url: /tool/
```

### Customizing Cover Image

You can set your own cover image by modifying the `cover_image` variable in `_config.yml`, and you can also set different cover images on different pages by setting the `cover_image` variable on each page.

If you discover that the contrast between the cover text color and the cover background color is not enough, you can also adjust these two variables:

```yml
cover_bg_color: rgb(40, 73, 77)
cover_color: rgb(255, 255, 255)
```

### Customizing Social Links

You can set your social links in `_data/social.yml`. You can custom titles, URLs, and icons (only support [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) currently), for example:

```yml
- title: Email
  url: mailto://ganfan.man.2023@gmail.com
  icon: fas fa-envelope
- title: Twitter
  url: https://twitter.com/Ganfan_man
  icon: fab fa-twitter
- title: GitHub
  url: https://github.com/Gan-fan-man
  icon: fab fa-github
```

### Enabling Posts Archive

Esserco Avoink supports archiving posts by date, category and tag. It is enabled by default.

If you want to adjust them you need to modify `_data/archive.yml`:

```yml
- type: dates
  title: Dates
  url: /dates/
- type: categories
  title: Categories
  url: /categories/
- type: tags
  title: Tags
  url: /tags/
```

### Enabling TOC

If you want to show the TOC of a page on the right side, just set `toc: true` on that page.

The table of contents requires the use of

h1→h2→h3 arrangement requirements

does not allow

h1→h3

If you want to solve this problem, you can try to modify `_includes/sidebar-right.html`

Change

`include toc.html html=content h_min=1 h_max=6 class="toc"`

to

`include toc.html html=content h_min=2 h_max=3 class="toc"`

This can avoid the problem of incorrect display, but it will filter out level 1 titles and level 4~6 titles

### Enabling MathJax

If you want to write mathematics on a POST, just set `math: true` on that POST to enable MathJax.

## Advanced Development

Below is a detailed guide to website development. If you need to delve deeper into this project, please read these carefully. It may be helpful to you.

### Website-Structure

Open the root directory and you will find these files (before the website is built)

The folders you will find are
```
_data             # Stores site-wide configuration data, in YAML format, for dynamic content generation (e.g., navigation, social links).
_includes         # Contains reusable snippets of HTML, Liquid, or Markdown that can be included across multiple layouts or pages.
_layouts          # Defines the structural templates for different types of pages or content.
_posts            # Houses all blog posts, organized by year, month, and day (YYYY-MM-DD-title.md).
_sass             # Stores Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) files, which are compiled into CSS for styling the website.
_tools            # A custom collection defined, for showcasing specific tools or projects.
assets            # Stores static assets like CSS, JavaScript files, and fonts that are directly served to the browser.
images            # Dedicated folder for storing all images used throughout the website.
pages             # Contains independent pages that do not belong to the _posts or _tools collections. Defines the website display structure.
scripts           # Holds scripts used for website functionality.
```

`_includes` Folder Files

The `_includes` folder is a repository for modular HTML, Liquid, or Markdown snippets that can be embedded into various layouts or pages, promoting reusability and maintainability.

* `content.html`: Influencing the footer's positioning and content.
* `cookie.html`: This file contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a multilingual cookie consent banner that appears at the bottom of the page.
* `custom-head.html`: Provides a designated placeholder for developers to insert custom `<head>` elements, such as favicons, meta tags, or third-party script includes.
* `disqus.html`: As the name suggests, this file integrates the Disqus comment system into relevant pages.
* `google-analytics.html`: Responsible for embedding the Google Analytics tracking code to monitor website traffic and user behavior.
* `head.html`: The global `<head>` section of the HTML document, containing essential metadata, stylesheets, and script links that apply to all.
* `mathjax.html`: Calling the MathJax library to enable rendering of mathematical equations on pages where it's enabled.
* `post-header.html`: Responsible for the header display of the post page Can modify `_data/archive.yml` to adjust the display target
* `post-tags.html`: Dynamically extract tags from the article's metadata and, depending on the site configuration, display clickable tag links or just plain text tags
* `scroll.html`: Control the scrolling behavior of the page, especially on mobile devices, and manage scroll state.
* `sidebar-left.html`: Defines the content and structure of the left sidebar, used for link display
* `sidebar-right.html`: Defines the content and structure of the right sidebar, used to call TOC
* `toc.html`: Renders the Table of Contents (TOC) for a page, dynamically generating links to its headings.

`_layouts` Folder Files

The `_layouts` folder contains the blueprint templates that define the overall structure and presentation of different types of content on the website.

* `archive-dates.html`: The layout specifically for displaying chronological archives of posts, organized by date.
* `archive-taxonomies.html`: The layout used for displaying archives based on categories or tags (taxonomies).
* `base.html`: A base layout that establishes the basic HTML structure. All layouts except `post.html` use this layout.
* `default.html`: This is the standard template for `_posts` content.
* `home.html`: The specific layout for the website's main homepage.
* `page.html`: Common styles designed for `base.html`. It provides the necessary CSS and defines the main content area of ​​this type of page.
* `post.html`: A dedicated layout for rendering a single post, providing specific structure and elements unique to a single post view, based on `default.html`.
* `post_home.html`: This layout specifically controls how blog posts are displayed on the post home page, based on `default.html`.
* `tool.html`: A dedicated layout for rendering a single tool page, providing specific structure and elements unique to a single tool view, based on `base.html`.
* `tool_home.html`: This layout specifically controls how blog tools are displayed on the tool home page, based on `base.html`.

### Page definition-tool

The overall structure of the tool page

The definitions of all non-homepage and article pages come from `base.html`.

and the CSS style of `base.html` is in `page.html`.

Therefore, all non-homepage and article pages will reference `page.html` as the basic style.

including `tool` `tool_home` `about` `404.html`

In the website structure, all tools are displayed in `/tool`

And the url of the tool page needs to be set manually

Their headers should be like this
``` markdown
---
layout: tool
title: XXX
permalink: /tool/XXX/
---
```
Then you can freely create tools

**Also note that when using the layout: tool, the system automatically creates a div block named “page” to display the content when a header is detected.**

For example, `test.html`

Write
``` markdown
---
layout: tool
title: test
permalink: /tool/test/
---
<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">A test page</h2>
```
When output, it will be
``` html
<article class="page">
<div class="tool-page-container">
<h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">A test page</h2>
</div>
```

### Page definition-post

The overall structure of post

All post pages are defined in `default.html`.

The CSS styles for `default.html` are in `_sass/default.scss`.

Therefore, all article pages refer to `default.html` as their base style.

This includes `post.html` `post_home.html` `archive-taxonomies.html` `archive-dates.html`.

In the site structure, all files directly based on default.html are shown in `/post`.

The time of each blog post The title needs to be set manually

The jekyll-paginate-v2 plugin will act as a paginate, and according to the `_config.yml` setting, it will automatically sort the posts in order from newest to oldest.

The title should look like this
``` markdown
---
layout: post
title: testpost
date: 2000-01-01 00:01 +0800
last_modified_at: 2099-12-31 23:59:59 +0800
categories: [X]
tags: [X]
toc: true
math: true
---
A test page
{: .message }
```
Note that the `{:.message }` is not required, but if it is, it creates a simple message below the header, where you can generally write a brief description of the post.

Once you've set it up, you can write posts freely.

### Unified CSS management

This `styles.scss` file serves as the main entry point for the website's styling. It orchestrates the entire visual presentation by importing various SCSS partials, defining global styles, and managing theme-specific adjustments.

**Global Variables**

The stylesheet heavily relies on variables defined in `_variables.scss`. These variables control:
* **Colors:** `--body-color`, `--link-color2`, `--yellow-100`, `--gray-900`, `--gray-500`, etc., for consistent color schemes.
* **Spacing:** `--spacer`, `--spacer-2`, `--spacer-3` to maintain uniform spacing throughout the layout.
* **Typography:** `--body-font`, `--code-font`, `--body-font-size`, `--body-line-height` for consistent font usage and readability.
* **Layout:** `$sm-width`, `$md-width`, `$lg-width` for responsive breakpoints.
* **Other:** `--border-radius`, `--code-bg`, and specific variables for tool sections (e.g., `--tool-bg`, `--tool-content-bg`).

**Development Guide**

1.  **Modular Approach:** Styles are organized into small, thematic partials (e.g., `_layout.scss`, `_posts.scss`). This promotes modularity and makes it easier to locate and modify specific styles.
2.  **Variable Usage:** Utilize the variables defined in `_variables.scss` for colors, spacing, and typography to ensure consistency and simplify theme changes.
3.  **Syntax Highlighting:** The file includes mixins from `_syntax.scss` to apply light and dark syntax highlighting themes based on the user's `prefers-color-scheme` setting, ensuring code readability in different environments.
4.  **Responsive Design:** Media queries are used in partials like `_layout.scss` to adapt the design for various screen sizes, promoting a responsive user experience.

**Extensibility**

* **New Partials:** To add new sections or components, create a new SCSS partial (e.g., `_new-component.scss`) and import it into `styles.scss`.
* **Variable Updates:** Global style changes can be efficiently managed by updating the values in `_variables.scss`.
* **Theme Customization:** The use of CSS variables (e.g., `var(--body-color)`) and SCSS mixins for themes allows for easy customization and creation of new themes without altering core component styles.
* **Component-Specific Overrides:** For specific adjustments to existing components, create a dedicated SCSS file for overrides and import it, or add the styles directly to the relevant partial.
