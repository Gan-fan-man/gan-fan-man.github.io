## Features

Compared to lightbox, the following features have been added

- Mouse Drag Image: Click the left mouse button to drag the image.
- Mouse Wheel Zoom: Zoom in/out on images by using the mouse wheel.

## Quick Start

Getting Started Quickly

### Get the Plugin via Git

**Cloning the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gan-fan-man/MahouBox.git
cd MahouBox
```

### Get the Plugin from Releases

Download the latest version from the [Github release page](https://github.com/Gan-fan-man/mahoubox/releases).

Extract the necessary files, such as:
- mahoubox.css
- jquery-3.7.1.min.js
- mahoubox.js

### Installation

In your project's global header file (e.g., head.html), include the plugin using the following syntax:

- `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/mahoubox.css" />`
- `<script src="/assets/js/jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></script>`
- `<script src="/assets/js/mahoubox.js"></script>`

> **Note: Replace with your project's path.**

## Configure the plugin

To configure the plugin after installation, you need to change a few URLs in mahoubox.css to ensure all elements work correctly.

While you have the option to change these paths, it's recommended to place the image assets in the '... /images/' directory as specified in the CSS.

Once the images are configured, the plugin should work correctly.

> **Note**: After the configuration is complete, it is best to use the F12 developer tools to ensure the plugin is not reporting any errors.

### Usage

The plugin supports two syntaxes for calling images:

1. To create a single image, use the following syntax:

- `<a href="url/1.jpg" data-mahoubox="image-1">Image #1</a>`

2. To create a collection of images, use the following syntax:

- `<a href="url/1.jpg" data-mahoubox="group">Image #1</a>`
- `<a href="url/2.jpg" data-mahoubox="group">Image #2</a>`

> When multiple image links share the same group name, they are treated as a single album.  
> When multiple image links have different group names or no group name, each will be treated as a separate image.

### Optional Syntax

1. `data-title="title"` : Display the title of the image in the lower left corner

2. `<a href="url/1.jpg" ... ><img class="your-class-name" src="your-image-url.jpg"></a>` : The content inside the `<a>` tag (like the `<img>`) is the element displayed before the plugin is opened. This is customizable.
