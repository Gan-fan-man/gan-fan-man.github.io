# gan-fan-man.github.io  by Ganfan_man

**Gan-fan-man.github.io** This project is Ganfan_man's personal website  
  
The theme used for this project is [Not Pure Poole](https://github.com/vszhub/not-pure-poole)
The plugin I use in that site:  
> [Not Pure Poole](https://github.com/vszhub/not-pure-poole) : theme
> [lightbox](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2) : Picture View
> [video.js](https://github.com/videojs/video.js) : Web Video Player (Not used for the time being)

If you'd like me to share the website presets and plugins I'm currently using you can contact me on [X](https://x.com/Ganfan_man)  
By the way, I modified the lightbox source code (lightbox.js) on my website.
I'll share that revised source code in a few days and put the link here
